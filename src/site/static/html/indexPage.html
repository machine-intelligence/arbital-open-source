				Have you ever wondered <b>why Wikipedia can't systematize good explanations?</b>  One reason is that every reader comes in with a different level of background knowledge and needs a different explanation, and Wikipedia pages don't have alternative <a href="/pages/1407630090992422901" class="intrasite-link" page-id="1407630090992422901">tabs</a>.
			</p>

				Have you ever wondered <b>why Wikipedia doesn't try to record large debates?</b>  One reason is that Wikipedia relies mostly on name lookups to steer everyone interested in the same issue into the same page, and it hasn't solved the problem of steering people to particular details of a complicated argument.

				Have you ever wondered <b>why Reddit communities that start out with high standards go downhill?</b>  One reason is that Reddit only allows a choice between upvoting, downvoting, and doing nothing; and the most upvotes are dispensed by the people with the lowest standards for upvoting.

			Arbital is a new startup devoted to tackling the hard problems and deep structures that underpin the horrific state of online discussion.  We all dream of a world where we only need to argue once about whether Vitamin D3 is a better nutritional supplement than Vitamin D2, and everytime anyone on Earth raises a question that's already been answered, we just link to that question's location in the central repository, and see at a glance <a href="/pages/8676677094741262267" class="intrasite-link" page-id="8676677094741262267">the distribution</a> of expert opinions.  But creating that world isn't as simple as just trying to create "Wikipedia for arguments".  It requires <a href="/pages/5092144177314150382" class="intrasite-link" page-id="5092144177314150382">new technology</a> for authors and readers.
